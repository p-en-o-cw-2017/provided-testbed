v1.0
- First version
v1.1
- The GUI is now constructed in the AWT event-handling thread is as well (for thread-safety). For the autopilot this means that both AutopilotFactory.createAutopilot() and all Autopilot interface methods are called from the AWT event-handling thread.
- Updating components now have their preferred size set to their size after initialization. This should stop GUI lay-out from "moving around" due to changes in displayed values.
- getElapsedTime() now returns the correct value: the amount of time since the start of the simulation, not the amount of time since the last update.
- Re-added readme sections I accidentally removed earlier.
v1.2
- The testbed now replaces infinite and NaN outputs by zero while printing an error message. Finite thrust outputs outside of the range [0, maxThrust] are still silently capped.
- You can now pre-define your configuration variables in config.txt, which are loaded by the testbed during initialization. More detailed instructions have been added to the readme.
v1.3
- Removed version numbers from all files except for the changelog since I always forget to update them ...

v2.0
- Updated the provided testbed for the second semester assignment.
v2.1
- Fixed ProvidedTestbed.jar (forgot to remove some packages).
- Updated readme with explanation for finite ground.
v2.2
- Added option to fix rear wheel braking axis to projection of plane's Z-axis (this used to be the only implementation, now it's opt-in).
